# Let's Program a Subnet

Next, we are going to create, deploy, and use a subnet locally with our core wallet and Metamask, in order to deploy code using Remix and Hardhat.

## Installation of Requirements

To begin with this, we need to install the Avalanche CLI in our terminal, but first, we must ask ourselves, what operating system do we have?

### Linux

For this operating system, we need to open a terminal and copy the following:

1.  <div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; margin: 10px; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;">
        curl -sSfL
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli/main/scripts/install.sh
        | sh -s
    </div>

2.  <div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; margin: 10px; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;">
        export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
    </div>

3.  <div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; margin: 10px; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;">
        export PATH=~/bin:$PATH >> .bashrc
    </div>

Now let's understand what happened?.

1. In step <b>1</b> we downloaded and installed the binary file we need to use Avalanche CLI in our terminal.

2. In step <b>2</b> we exported this path so we can call our binary file from any path in our terminal (Note: The code works as is if we are in the root path in the terminal. How do we know that? Because our terminal starts like this: <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">usuario@perfil:~$</span>, if we were in a path, the path would be observed after the ~ symbol and before the <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">$</span> symbol like this <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">usuario@perfil:~/myfolder$</span>).

3. Now it's set up, but we don't want to have to export this every time, so we add it to a file that is executed when opening the terminal, in this case, our terminal runs <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">bash</span> so the code is sent to the <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">.bashrc</span> file, if our terminal runs <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">zsh</span> we must send the code to <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">.zshrc</span>, now you may wonder if you are not sure which one your PC uses, no problem, type <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">cat .bashrc</span> if this shows something, your terminal uses <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">bash</span>, in my case when I do it, I receive the contents of the file, and when running <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">cat .zshrc</span> I receive this: <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">cat: .zshrc: No such file or directory</span> which means my terminal uses <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">bash</span> instead of <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">zsh</span>.

### Windows

Being honest with you, everything above that works on Linux, I did it all from Windows, so you can be sure that here we can also use Avalanche CLI. However, instead of using any terminal, we need to go to the <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">microsoft store</span> and download <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">Ubuntu.</span> This will create a small partition that will give us a workspace with the <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">Ubuntu</span> distribution of <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">Linux</span> which brings us back to the previous step. By typing the word <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">Ubuntu</span> in our search bar, it will show us a terminal. When we open it, we'll be right about to start step <b>1</b> of the Linux example, so needless to say, what follows is to follow steps 1, 2, and 3 described for <b>Linux</b>.

### MAC

Go to the official Avalanche academy in the section <a href="https://academy.avax.network/path-player?courseid=subnet-architecture&unit=subnet-architecture_6466810da734bUnit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold; color: black;">Install Avalanche CLI en MacOs</a>.

## Subnet Creation

Let's start by creating a basic subnet. For this, we need to have our terminal open (Windows users, remember to have the <b>Ubuntu</b> terminal open), now, let's execute the following command: <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">avalanche subnet create testNet</span>, but what does this mean?

1. <b>avalanche</b>: We're instructing the terminal to utilize the Avalanche
   CLI. It's akin to python, python3, node, npx, etc., but in this case, we're
   opting for Avalanche CLI.

2. <b>subnet</b>: We're specifying the type of process we want to invoke, in
   this instance, a subnet (we'll explore others later).

3. <b>create</b>: We're instructing it to call the create method of the process
   associated with subnets. It's akin to treating <b>subnet</b> as a class and
   invoking <b>subnet.create</b>.

4. <b>testNet</b>: This is the arbitrary name I chose for this subnet. I could
   have selected pikachu, pikaNet, redRanger, rickPrimeNet, or any other name,
   but I settled on testNet. In this scenario, following the earlier analogy,
   it's like calling <b>subnet.create("testNet")</b>.

Now that we grasp this statement, let's begin.

-   <b>Virtual Machine Selection</b>: Once the command <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">
        avalanche subnet create testNet
    </span> has been executed on the command line, we'll be prompted to choose
    between two options: a Subnet that utilizes the Ethereum virtual machine (
    <b>Subnet-EVM</b>), allowing us to program smart contracts in Solidity and
    use addresses like 0x... with ease and familiarity; or a custom virtual
    machine (<b>Custom</b>), which enables us to use another operating system
    like Rust for our code and requires us to input the path to the genesis
    block configuration. Since we're taking the straightforward route, we'll
    select <b>Subnet-EVM</b> this time.

-   <b>Chain Identifier Selection for the Subnet</b>: The concept of <b>
        chainId
    </b> might seem a bit confusing at first, but it's nothing too complicated;
    it's just like our identification number. Every blockchain has one, and it's
    important not to duplicate it, as it would be awkward if someone shared your
    same identification number. Also, sharing the same identification number in
    the blockchain universe can cause confusion. To ensure we don't repeat, we
    consult the unique registry of blockchain identification documents (I made
    up that name) at https://chainlist.org. We specify that we want to include
    documents for both adults and minors (meaning including Testnets), and then
    we perform the search. For example, if today is January 27, 2024, I'll try
    the number <b>270124</b>, and voila! It's available. Now, I know I can use <b>
        270124
    </b> as a chainId since it won't collide with another blockchain identification
    document. Just like this, I can try any other number, and the https://chainlist.org
    page will provide me with its availability.

-   <b>Selection of a Symbol for the Native Token:</b> This attribute might seem
    a bit confusing, but let's think of the native token like a country's currency.
    In my case, I'm writing this from Colombia, where our native token is the <b>
        Colombian Peso,
    </b> but it has an alias for quicker identification, which is three letters long,
    the <b>COP</b>. Similarly, blockchains and subnets can have a long name like
    Bitcoin and have an associated symbol (BTC), Avax (AVAX), Ether (ETH), Matic
    (MATIC), etc. So, when it's time to select a symbol, I'll choose <b>TNET</b>,
    which I consider to be an acronym for testNet. I could use anything else like <b>
        TNT,
    </b> <b>MYT,</b> <b>ASD,</b> or anything unrelated to the project, but for consistency,
    I'll go with <b>TNET.</b>

-   <b>Selection of the Ethereum Virtual Machine Version to Use:</b> Since we've
    decided to use the Ethereum virtual machine as the processing engine, this machine
    has undergone modifications and improvements over time, resulting in several
    versions. It's advisable to try to always use the latest version as it usually
    has more security patches to protect against common hacking incidents. Therefore,
    I recommend selecting the option labeled <b>Use latest version.</b>

-   <b>Fee Configuration:</b> This section might seem a bit confusing due to discussing
    fees and having to select disk capacity, but they go hand in hand. The lower
    the disk capacity, the less information it can process, making it more costly
    to process. However, if the virtual machines running the subnet have higher capacity,
    they can execute more transactions at a lower cost since the hardware is more
    powerful for this purpose. We can also customize these fees. Since this is our
    first subnet, I recommend selecting a high-capacity disk that allows processing
    of 5,000 gas units per second (<b>
        High disk use / High Throughput 5 thousand gas/s
    </b>).

-   <b>Funds Distribution:</b> This step is crucial because we've chosen a traditional
    configuration where we need to pay gas to process transactions. This means we
    need to have tokens of <b>TNET</b> to pay those fees. However, since the <b>
        TNET
    </b> token is just about to be created, we don't have any supplies of it in our
    wallets yet. Avalanche CLI gives us two options: either we provide 1 million
    tokens to a default address, from which we'll later receive the private key to
    import into our wallet, or we pass one or more public addresses, which will be
    configured from the genesis block as wallets with balances to pay gas. In this
    case, I'll choose the second option since I want to use my trusted account that
    I use for testing. I'll copy this address 0x... from core and select the option <b>
        Customize your airdrop,
    </b> this will prompt me to enter the address 0x... that will receive the tokens
    (<b>Address to airdrop to</b>). So, I'll paste the address 0x... that I obtained
    from core, followed by hitting the enter key. After this, it will ask me for
    the amount <b>Amount to airdrop (in AVAX units),</b> that's because each token
    has decimals in a clever way, since decimals (0.1) can't be used, for example,
    in Solidity. A standard of decimals is defined, and in reality, the unit is given
    by many zeros. For example, an AVAX is not 1 token, it's 1 x 10^9 tokens. So
    saying <b>in AVAX units</b> refers to mentioning how many tokens I want to receive
    considering that each token will be multiplied by 1 x 10^9. Then, if I write
    1000000 (1 million), in code, I'll receive 1 million times 10 to the power of
    9, but visually I'll only see 1 million, and the gas will cost fractions of 1,
    like 0.001 TNET, but we already know that this fraction is fictitious since 0.001
    TNET is 1 x 10^6 tokens, as they are less than the unit, they appear as decimals,
    but internally they are more than 1. This is very important when programming
    smart contracts involving crypto assets like the native token or an ERC20 token
    because it will be just my account. I'll say No to the question of whether I
    would like to airdrop more tokens (<b>
        Would you like to airdrop more tokens?
    </b>).

-   <b>Would you like to add a custom precompile to modify the EVM?:</b> This is
    a more advanced topic that we'll address at another time. For now, let's try
    to understand what we've covered so far and finish configuring our virtual machine,
    so we'll select No to the question of <b>
        Advanced: Would you like to add a custom precompile to modify the EVM?
    </b>

-   <b>Success Message 😎:</b> If everything was configured correctly, we should
    see the following message: <b>Successfully created subnet configuration</b>

## Viewing My Subnets

-   If we want to see the list of subnets we have created on our device, we run the command <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">avalanche subnet list</span>, which following the analogy we laid out at the beginning is like calling the <b>subnet.list()</b> function from Avalanche CLI, which does not require any input parameters. Calling this will return a table with information such as the subnet name, the chainId, the virtual machine ID (VMID), and other details like the type of virtual machine and its version, as well as whether it comes from a repository or the default one was used.

-   If we want to see detailed information about a specific subnet, we execute the command <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">avalanche subnet describe testNet</span>, in this case ending with the name of our subnet, in my case, I named it testNet. Following the analogy, it's equivalent to <b>subnet.describe("testNet"),</b> as this time it does receive an attribute, which is the name of the subnet we want information about. This will give us <b>details, gas configuration</b> information, <b>airdrops</b> (showing the amount and the receiving address), as well as precompiles, in this case, I see <b>No precompiles set</b> because I didn't configure any.

## Setting Up a Local Node (Before Deployment)

This step is sometimes overlooked, but it's healthier to perform it to avoid errors in the future. So at this point, we're going to run the command <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">avalanche network start</span> to start five nodes on our computer locally. Now, let's run the command <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">avalanche network status</span> to see the status of these nodes we just started. We should see the identifier of each node as well as the endpoint used to expose them.

Note: Here the class is no longer subnet but network 👀

## Subnet Deployment

At this point, we have configured a Subnet and exposed the nodes, everything is set up to start the rocket launch (deployment of our subnet). To do this, we'll execute the command <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">avalanche subnet deploy testNet</span> (subnet.deploy("testnet"))

-   <b>Selection of a network for deployment operation:</b> Here, it's like selecting
    an environment. For local testing, which is the purpose of this section, we'll
    select the local network.

-   Gathering Important Data: Once the subnet is deployed, it will throw a bunch of information at us, but what's really important from all of this?

    -   <b>RPC URL:</b> Remote Procedure Call URL, remember that the blockchain is
        not a webpage, it's a cryptographic storage and communication standard with
        gamification among devices; that is, a group of devices agree on how to add
        information and communicate it to each other, receiving a benefit for doing
        so in the expected manner. These devices are our gateway to reading or adding
        information, so we must send our read or write request to them. Only authorized
        nodes can interact. An <b>RPC</b> is like an API that we can write to, using
        web2 architecture with web3 world information.

    -   <b>Funded address:</b> The address with the funds is our test address, we
        verify it.

    -   <b>Network name:</b> We verify that it says <b>testNet</b> or the name we
        gave it.

    -   <b>Chain ID:</b> We verify that it is the one we chose, in my case it's <b>
            270124
        </b>

    -   <b>Currency Symbol:</b> We verify that it's our acronym <b>TNET</b>

## Importing the Subnet into Core

To import a blockchain, in this case a subnet, we must be clear about the final points from the previous step, such as the RPC, the chainId, etc., with these in hand, we'll continue with the following:

1. Open the core wallet as a browser extension or on our mobile device.

2. Click on the dropdown list at the top right, which has the Avalanche logo.

    <img src="/images/core_1.png" alt="core 1" style="max-width: 90%" />

3. Click on the last option with an icon of a gear, which is Manage Networks.

4. Click on the + icon on the right.

    <img src="/images/core_2.png" alt="core 2" style="max-width: 90%" />

5. Once here, it will ask for:

    a. <b>RPC URL:</b> http://127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/27J…wEH/rpc (Our RPC).

    b. <b>Network Name:</b> testNet.

    c. <b>Chain ID:</b> 270124.

    d. <b>Network Token Symbol:</b> TNET

    e. <b>Network Token Name:</b> TestNet coin (Name others will see for the token)

    Leave the rest blank for now, then click <b>Save.</b>

6. Once the network is added, click on it, and in the main section of the wallet, we should see something like this:

    <img src="/images/core_3.png" alt="core 3" style="max-width: 90%" />

    If we've reached this point, congratulations! We now have our subnet in our core wallet, and we can use it to deploy smart contracts in <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold; color: black;">Remix</a>.

## Importing the Subnet into Metamask

To import a blockchain, in this case, a subnet, we must be clear about the final points from the previous step, such as the RPC, the chainId, etc. With these in hand, we'll continue with the following:

1. Open the Metamask wallet as a browser extension or on our mobile device.

2. Click on the dropdown list at the top left in our web extension or at the top center in the mobile application.

    <img src="/images/metamask_1.png" alt="metamask 1" style="max-width: 90%" />

3. Once the menu is open, click on Add Network.

    <img src="/images/metamask_2.png" alt="metamask 2" style="max-width: 90%" />

4. This will open a new tab; here, click on <b>Add a network manually</b>.

    <img src="/images/metamask_3.png" alt="metamask 3" style="max-width: 90%" />

5. It will ask for the following:

    a. <b>Network Name:</b> testNet

    b. <b>New RPC URL:</b> http://127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/27J…wEH/rpc (Our RPC)

    c. <b>Chain ID:</b> 270124

    d. <b>Currency Symbol:</b> TNET

    Then, click on <b>Save</b>, followed by seeing the following message:

    <img src="/images/metamask_4.png" alt="metamask 4" style="max-width: 90%" />

6. Click on Switch to testNet, and you'll see the following:

    <img src="/images/metamask_5.png" alt="metamask 5" style="max-width: 90%" />

In this case, I don't have tokens because the address is different from the one I received airdrops on, but I can send tokens from my core account to use Metamask, or I could have added this address as the recipient when creating the subnet. In any case, I now have my subnet added to my core and Metamask wallets.

## Stopping the Running Nodes

Sometimes we close the terminal and think we've closed everything, but the process continues to run the nodes in the background. To stop them, we can check if they are running with <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">avalanche network status</span> and then stop them with <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">avalanche network stop</span>, or stop them from the beginning, as you prefer.

## Restarting the Previously Deployed Nodes and Subnets

To restart the stopped nodes, we execute the command <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">avalanche network start</span>.

## Deleting Deployed Subnets from the Nodes

To remove the state of the subnets from the nodes, we must run the command <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">avalanche network clean</span>, thereby cleaning the local node deployments.

## Deleting the Subnet

If we want to permanently delete the configuration we made for our subnet, we execute the following command <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">avalanche subnet delete testNet</span>, ending the existence of our subnet <span style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; font-family: monospace;">testNet</span> on our device 😢

Now, there are occasions where we want to access digital assets or information that are on another subnet or another blockchain like the C - Chain. For example, to leverage the properties of an NFT in a project on the main net and provide benefits in our new subnet. For such cases, the Avalanche team is developing a technology, which we have in Beta and can start testing right away. This technology allows us to communicate between the Dispatch (D), Echo (E) subnets, and the C-Chain. This technology is called Teleporter.
