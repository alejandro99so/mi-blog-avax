# What is a Subnet?

If we analyze the term "Subnet" literally, we conclude that it consists of two words: "sub" and "net", which translate to: "sub" meaning below or sharing qualities of something larger; and "net", which means network. This implies a Blockchain that shares something with another larger one. Now, what exactly is shared?

Subnets share the configurations used to build Avalanche's C-Chain, which is the production Blockchain where Smart Contracts are currently being executed and deployed. Therefore, Avalanche offers the possibility of creating a blockchain that shares the consensus mechanism, programming language for contracts, and all the necessary configurations to have a Blockchain up and running.

But it doesn't stop there, because it also allows us to do the following things:

1. <b>Modify the capacity of the virtual machine</b> processing transactions, allowing
   us to have more processing power on the blockchain and resulting in a much higher
   gas limit. This accommodates new projects whose entry into the Blockchain was
   hindered by the capacity of existing virtual machines.

2. <b>Define a whitelist of users who can interact with the Blockchain,</b>
   allowing for control over the transactions made on the Blockchain. This is of
   utmost importance for governmental entities where the entities ensuring trust
   are often centralized to ensure factors such as confidentiality.

3. <b>Define a whitelist of validators</b>, which is very useful for public
   entities. It allows blockchain users to safeguard information within a
   geographical physical boundary, opening up the possibility for public
   entities to store their data on this new blockchain. This is very important
   for them as it ensures the confidentiality of information under national
   borders.

4. <b>Define a type of virtual machine such as EVM or WASM</b>, allowing
   developers to develop Smart Contracts in languages like Solidity or Rust
   according to their business model. This gives them a language that adapts
   more to their needs and is not imposed by a third party.

5. <b>Precompiles in the new blockchains</b>, this is a more advanced but very
   interesting topic. It allows the development of some native functions for the
   new blockchain at a lower level, functions that are optimized like libraries
   in a traditional programming language. These must be performed before
   creating the subnet, as it must be factory-configured to access these new
   native properties.

6. <b>Having its own token</b> is a huge competitive advantage if used wisely, as
   it decouples the project's economy and the information traffic it generates from
   any other network like the C-Chain. This gives the true power of "infinite scalability",
   as if this new subnet is configured correctly, it will have the ability to process
   a lot of information at an insignificant gas price. However, the gas is paid in
   this new native token that has nothing to do with Avax on the C-Chain, so the
   project will not affect the price of Avax on the main network. This can be a double-edged
   sword, if used correctly, it can generate a prosperous economic system, but if
   not, it can lead the project to disaster. Tokens in projects are similar to coins
   in countries; they must manage their treasury as if it were their central bank
   and prevent at all costs their system from becoming that of an economy in crisis
   like Venezuela or Argentina. This is a delicate and interesting topic to address.

The above are some examples and cases of potential improvements that a subnet can have using Avalanche technology.
