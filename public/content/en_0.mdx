# What is Avalanche?

Avalanche is a Blockchain which, according to the official <a href="https://www.avax.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold; color: black;">Avalanche</a> website, is described as:

<blockquote style="position: relative; padding-left: 20px; margin-left: 10px; border-left: 4px solid #ccc; font-style: italic;">
    Build anything you want, any way you want on the lightning fast, scalable
    blockchain that won’t let you down. Choosing the wrong blockchain can kill
    your dApp before it ever has a chance to succeed, but it doesn’t have to be
    this way. Launch with confidence on Avalanche.
</blockquote>

Therefore, if we keep this premise in mind, we can expect to find something that allows us to achieve that desired ultra-fast scalability. Indeed, Avalanche offers us a technology called Subnets, which promises to be the solution to the scalability issues of modern projects and much more.
